# Individual Research Module (IM): Architecture Search for a Lightweight rs-fMRI CNN for Brain Age Prediction

In this project, I am developing a lightweight one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) to predict a subject's brain age using the mean activation timeseries of independent components of rs-fMRI recordings of the UK Biobank (UKBB).
Two data modalities are tested against each other: 25 vs. 100 independent components, as provided by the UKBB.
